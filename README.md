Given a user selected song on Spotify, return five similar songs from my own music library. Using Spotify's API, I extracted my library of music and 16 numeric features attached with them labeled by Spotify. Some of the features are tempo, acousticness, liveness, key and mode, and popularity. I normalized these features and compare them to the user given song using a measurement called cosine similarity.
